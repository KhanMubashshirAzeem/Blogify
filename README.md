## ðŸš€ Excited to Share My New App: Blogify! ðŸš€
### Hi everyone,
### Iâ€™ve made an app called Blogify using Android Studio, Firebase, Java, and XML.
### With Blogify, users can:
### Sign up and create an account
### Post updates that show up on their page and in the community
### Edit and delete their posts
### Bookmark their favorite posts
### Change their profile picture

#### Iâ€™m really proud of this project and canâ€™t wait to see how it grows!
